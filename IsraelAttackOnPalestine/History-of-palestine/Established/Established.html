      <div class="History">
        <h1>Establishment</h1>
        <p>Later, the All-Palestine Government was established by the Arab League on 22 September 1948 to govern the All-Palestine Protectorate in the Egyptian-occupied Gaza Strip. It was soon recognized by all Arab League members except Transjordan, which had occupied and later annexed the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</p>

      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>The history of the Palestinian people is deeply intertwined with the broader history of the Levant region, which encompasses modern-day Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. Here is a brief overview of their ancient history</p>
    <h1>Ancient Canaanites</h1>
    <p>The earliest known inhabitants of the region were the Canaanites, who settled in the area around 3000 BCE. They established city-states and engaged in trade with neighboring civilizations.</p>

    <h1>Israelite Conquest</h1>
    <p>Around 1200 BCE, according to biblical accounts, the Israelites (Hebrews) under Joshua's leadership are said to have conducted a military campaign to conquer parts of Canaan. This period is known as the Israelite Conquest.</p>

    <h1>Philistine Arrival</h1>
    <p>The Philistines, believed to have originated from the Aegean region, settled along the coastal plain of ancient Canaan around the 12th century BCE. They were one of the major groups in the region.</p>

    <h1>Assyrian and Babylonian Rule</h1>
    <p>In the 8th and 7th centuries BCE, the Assyrians and later the Babylonians conquered the region, leading to the exile of many Israelites.</p>

    <h1>Persian Period</h1>
    <p>The Persian Empire, after conquering Babylon, allowed some Jews to return to the region. This period saw the reconstruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem.</p>

    <h1>Hellenistic and Roman Eras</h1>
    <p>In the wake of Alexander the Great's conquests, the region came under Hellenistic influence. Later, it fell under Roman control, leading to the birth of Christianity.</p>

    <h1>Byzantine Period</h1>
    <p>The region remained under Roman and later Byzantine rule until the 7th century.</p>

    <h1>Islamic Conquest</h1>
    <p>In 636 CE, the Arab-Muslim armies under Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab defeated the Byzantine Empire and took control of the region.</p>

    <h1>Ottoman Empire</h1>
    <p>From the 16th century, the region was part of the Ottoman Empire, lasting until the early 20th century.</p>

    <h1>British Mandate</h1>
    <p>After World War I, the League of Nations granted Britain the mandate over Palestine, leading to the establishment of the British Mandate for Palestine.</p>

    <h1>Modern Political Developments</h1>
    <p>The early 20th century saw the emergence of both Zionist and Palestinian nationalist movements, each seeking their own vision for the region.</p>

    <h1>Partition and Statehood</h1>
    <p>The United Nations' 1947 Partition Plan proposed the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states. This plan led to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.</p>

    <p>Throughout this long history, the Palestinian people's identity and connection to the land have remained a central aspect of their cultural heritage and national consciousness. The complex history of the region continues to shape geopolitical dynamics and the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

                    <h2>Cremisan Monastery</h2>
                    <p>Cremisan Cellars is a winery in operation since the establishment of the monastery in the 19th century. Modern equipment was introduced in 1977.[3] The grapes are primarily harvested from the al-Khader area. Only 2% of the wine production (around 700,000 litres per year) is made from Cremisan's own grapes. The rest comes mainly from Beit Jala, Beit Shemesh, and the Hebron area.[3]</p>

                    <p>St. Nicholas made his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 312 AD, at a time when Palestine was emerging as the centre of the monastic movement. It is believed that he has lived in a cave located underneath the standing Greek Orthodox Church that carries his name. In the cave, visitors can see an icon of St. Nicholas and a flame burning in his honour.

                    <h2>The Church of the Annunciation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Church of the Annunciation (Latin: Basilica Annuntiationis, Arabic: كنيسة البشارة, Hebrew: כנסיית הבשורה), sometimes also referred to as the Basilica of the Annunciation, is a Catholic church in Nazareth, in northern Israel. It is one of two claimants to the site of the Annunciation – in which angel Gabriel appeared to the Virgin Mary and announced that she would give birth to Jesus – the other being the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation.[1][2]

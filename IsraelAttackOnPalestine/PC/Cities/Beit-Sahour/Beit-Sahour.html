                    <p>
                        The city of Beit Sahour holds a huge legacy of customs and traditions due to its origins going back to the Bronze Age (3000 B.C.). The Canaanites inhabited its numerous caves as traces of inhabitants were found in these caves, going back to Roman times.</p>

                    <h2>Shepherd's Sanctuary</h2>
                    <p>In 1858, the remains of a monastery built around 400 A.D. were discovered, on what was called the "Khirbet Siyar al-Ghanem" – the "Ruins of the Sheep Enclosure" or "Ruins of the Sheepfold").[8] The French official responsible for the excavations claimed to have found the three “shepherds’ tombs” mentioned by a pilgrim who visited Beit Sahour around the year 680. Between 1889 and 1906, the Franciscans succeeded in buying the land.

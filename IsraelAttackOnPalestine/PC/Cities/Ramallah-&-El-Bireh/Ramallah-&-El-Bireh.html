                    <p>Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center (مركز خليل السكاكيني الثقافي) is a leading Palestinian arts and culture organization that aims to create a pluralistic, critical liberating culture through research, query, and participation, and that provides an open space for the community to produce vibrant and liberating cultural content. Located in Ramallah, KSCC is housed in a renovated building, dating back to the early 20th century, based on traditional Palestinian architecture. Initially established in May 1996 as a branch of the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, KSCC was registered as a non-profit non-governmental organization (NGO) in 1998. The center is named after the Jerusalemite scholar, poet, and nationalist, Khalil Sakakini.

                        The centre holds art exhibits, book readings, poetry readings, children's activities and film screenings. Additionally to long term projects KSCC has also transferred some of its activities to facilities outside Ramallah, such as to Birzeit, Gaza City, and Bethlehem, to enable continuation of the projects during Israeli imposed curfews.[1]
                        
                        Adila Laïdi-Hanieh was the first director of the centre between 1996 and 2005.[2][3] Yazan Khalili has been the director since 2015.

Located in the Downtown district of the city, the mosque is named after the late Egyptian president and Arab leader Gamal Abdel Nasser.[1]

                        On March 14, 2002, the Israeli Army (IDF) took over the mosque and used its minaret for sniping, killing four Palestinians.[2]
                        
                        On September 22, 2007, dozens of wives of Hamas-affiliated political prisoners and other female Hamas members marched from the Jamal Abdel Nasser Mosque to Al-Manara Square in protest of what they saw as the politically motivated detentions of their relatives by the Palestinian Authority (PA). They were prevented from reaching the square when PA security forces used tear gas to disperse them.

It is considered to be the first Palestinian brewery and the first, pioneering microbrewery in the whole Middle East, having predated the first Israeli microbrewery by about ten year
                        Taybeh Brewery was co-founded in 1994, shortly after the signing of the first Oslo Accords in 1993, by Nadim Khoury and his brother David, whose family originated from Taybeh, but who grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts, where their family ran a liquor store.[3] As a college student in the 1980s at Hellenic College in Brookline, Nadim began making his own beer in the basement of the dorm where he lived.[5] He subsequently took up formal studies in brewing at UC Davis in California, eventually graduating with a master's degree

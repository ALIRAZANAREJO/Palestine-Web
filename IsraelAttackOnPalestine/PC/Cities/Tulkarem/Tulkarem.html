                    <h2> About Tulkarem</h2>
                    <p>Tulkarm or Tulkarem (Arabic: طولكرم, Ṭūlkarm) is a Palestinian city in the West Bank, the capital of the Tulkarm Governorate of the State of Palestine. The Israeli city of Netanya is to the west, and the Palestinian cities of Nablus and Jenin to the east. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, in 2017 Tulkarm had a population of 64,532.[1] Tulkarm is under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority.
                        During the Ayyubid era, after the Muslim reconquest of Palestine under Sultan Saladin in 1187, the first families to settle in Tulkarm were from the Kurdish clan of Zaydan.[8] A military group, the Zaydan were dispatched to the Wadi al-Sha'ir area, which includes Tulkarm, by Saladin to buttress the defense of the western approaches of Muslim-held Palestine from the Crusaders who dominated the coastal area

                    <h2>Masada National Park</h2>
                    <p>Masada (Hebrew: מְצָדָה məṣādā, "fortress"; Arabic: جبل مسعدة)[1] is an ancient fortification in southern Israel, situated on top of an isolated rock plateau, akin to a mesa. It is located on the eastern edge of the Judaean Desert, overlooking the Dead Sea 20 km (12 mi) east of Arad.

                        Herod the Great built two palaces for himself on the mountain and fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE.
                        
                        According to Josephus, the siege of Masada by Roman troops from 73 to 74 CE, at the end of the First Jewish–Roman War, ended in the mass suicide of the 960 Sicarii rebels who were hiding there. However, the archaeological evidence relevant to a mass suicide event is ambiguous at best and rejected entirely by some scholars.
                        
                        Masada is one of Israel's most popular tourist attractions.[5] During 2005 to 2007 and 2009 to 2012, it was the second-most popular, behind the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The site attracts around 750,000 visitors a year.

                    <h2>Beit She'an</h2>
                    <p>The Cave of the Patriarchs or Tomb of the Patriarchs, known to Jews by its Biblical name Cave of Machpelah (Biblical Hebrew: מְעָרַת הַמַּכְפֵּלָה, romanized: Məʿāraṯ ha-Mmaḵpēlāhⓘ, lit. 'Cave of the Double') and to Muslims as the Sanctuary of Abraham (Arabic: الحرم الإبراهيمي, romanized: al-Ḥaram al-Ibrāhīmīⓘ), is a series of caves situated 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem in the heart of the Old City of Hebron in the West Bank. According to the Abrahamic religions, the cave and adjoining field were purchased by Abraham as a burial plot, although most historians believe the Abraham-Isaac-Jacob narrative to be primarily mythological.[2][3] The site is considered a holy place in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[4][5][6]

                        Over the cave stands a large rectangular enclosure dating from the Herodian era.[7] During Byzantine rule of the region, a Christian basilica was built on the site; the structure was converted into the Ibrahimi Mosque following the Muslim conquest of the Levant. By the 12th century, the mosque and its surrounding regions had fallen under Crusader-state control, but were retaken in 1188 by the Ayyubid sultan Saladin, who again converted the structure into a mosque

                    <h2>Omar </h2>
                    <p>Omar (Arabic: عُمَرْ) or Omar Farouk (Persian: عمر فاروق) is a historical[1][2] Arab television drama miniseries-serial that was produced and broadcast by MBC1 and directed by the Syrian director Hatem Ali.[3] Co-produced by Qatar TV, the series is based on the life of Omar ibn al-Khattab (also spelled 'Umar', c. 583–644), the second Caliph of Islam, and depicts his life from 18 years old until the moments of his death.[3]

                        The series faced large controversies[4][5][6][7][8][9][10] due to its depiction of Omar, Abu Bakr, Uthman and Ali, the four Rashidun Caliphs,[11] along with other characters, who some Muslims believe should not be depicted, much like Mohammad. The series consists of 31 episodes and was originally aired in the month of Ramadan since July 20, 2012.[12][13][14] It was made at a cost of 200 million Saudi riyals and filmed in Morocco, primarily in the cities of Marakesh, Tangiers, El Jadida, Casablanca and Mohammedi

                    <p>Kfar Etzion (Hebrew: כְּפַר עֶצְיוֹן, lit. Etzion Village) is an Israeli settlement in the West Bank, organized as a religious kibbutz located in the Judean Hills between Jerusalem and Hebron in the southern West Bank, established in 1927, depopulated in 1948 and re-established in 1967. It is located 4.7 km east of the Green Line and falls under the jurisdiction of Gush Etzion Regional Council.[2][3] In 2021, Kfar Etzion had a population of 1,278.

                        The majority of the international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this.[4]

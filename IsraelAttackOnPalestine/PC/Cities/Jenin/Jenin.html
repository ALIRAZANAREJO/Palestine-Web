                    <h2> About Jenin</h2>
                    <p>Jenin (/ʒəˈniːn/; Arabic: جنين, Ǧinīn, pronunciationⓘ) is a city in the State of Palestine, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The city serves as the administrative center of the Jenin Governorate of Palestine and is a major center for the surrounding towns.[2] Jenin came under Israeli occupation in 1967, and was put under the administration of the Palestinian National Authority as Area A of the West Bank in 1993.

                        In 2017, Jenin had a population of approximately 50,000 people, whilst the Jenin refugee camp had a population of about 10,000, housing Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes during the 1948 Palestine War.[1][3] The camp has since become a stronghold of Palestinian militants, and the location of several incidents relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.</p>

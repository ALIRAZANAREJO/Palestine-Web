                    <h2> About Hebron</h2>
                    <p>Hebron (Arabic: الخليل al-Khalīl, pronunciationⓘ or خَلِيل الرَّحْمَن Khalīl al-Raḥmān;[4] Hebrew: חֶבְרוֹן Ḥevrōn, pronunciationⓘ) is a Palestinian city in the southern West Bank, 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Jerusalem. Nestled in the Judaean Mountains, it lies 930 metres (3,050 ft) above sea level. The second-largest city in the West Bank (after East Jerusalem) and the third-largest in the Palestinian territories (after East Jerusalem and Gaza), it had a population of 201,063 Palestinians in 2017 and seven hundred Jewish settlers concentrated on the outskirts of its Old City.[11] It includes the Cave of the Patriarchs, which Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions all designate as the burial site of three key patriarchal/matriarchal couples.The city is often considered one of the four holy cities in Judaism as well as in Islam.</p>
